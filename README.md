# A Novel Peak Detection System for Use with Microphysiological Systems which Mimic Human Nerve Fibers
An exploding topic in the scientific world currently is the microphysiological system (MPS) that offers a fast and cost-efficient alternative to traditional drug screening methods. Organoid-on-a-chip is a new technology that allows companies to structure 3D architectures that house biomimetic microversions of human body systems, ranging from heart cells in the cardiac system to tissue interfaces to complete human neurons. The last group is what research has been focused on at AxoSim Technologies located in New Orleans, LA.

### AxoSim's Nerve-on-a-Chip&trade;
AxoSim has developed a human nerve on a chip MPS using dual hydrogel systems which guide the neurite growth of a dorsal root ganglion tissue explant. The resulting neurons show distinct dendrite and neurite regions, which is amenable to clinical nerve compound action potential (CAP) and nerve fiber density (NFD) tests in vitro. These clinical tests, performed for the first time on a purely cellular <i>in vitro</i> model, are of great value for the study of acute and chronic exposure to drugs of interest. This is the first time that peripheral nerve patterns, like the CAP, have been observed in vitro, so the data generated from experiments involving the constructs is relatively new, although it shows resemblance to traditional action potentials. I was assigned to extract key parameters from the electrophysiological data.

### Electrophysiology and the CAP
The response of the human nerves growing within the patented constructs to clinical drugs was measured by conducting electrophysiological stimulation of the body and measuring how a compound action potential propagated along the grouped axons. Within each output file are 50 or more trace files, which display the waveforms as a result of 50 or more consecutive electrical stimulations. One such file, with time in milliseconds as the x-axis and amplified voltage in mV as the y-axis is found below:
